				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment is intended to generate a large variety of unique loglines for films using pre-existing characters and plot hooks, solely for entertainment purposes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This experiment was coded in javascript. A series of lists were created that were placed in a template string in a precise order, and within each list were a number of different</p>
				<p>character names, settings, plot hooks, and descriptive words that would be randomly selected each time the string is parsed. This javascript code was then hooked up to a basic HTML</p>
				<p>window such that each click of a button would generate a new film logline and display it on the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I (Ethan Clark) am the only one who worked on this. The assignment was very fun! I have worked with javascript and HTML multiple times before so this was a great refresher. </p>
